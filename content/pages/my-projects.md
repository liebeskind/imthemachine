<h2><a href="https://everipedia.org" style="color: black;">Everipedia</a></h2>

Everipedia is the Encyclopedia for Everything, Everyone, Everywhere. Built on the EOS blockchain, Everipedia offers a space for you to dive into anything you find interesting, connect with people who share your interests, and contribute your own perspective.

I am the Chief Product Officer and lead frontend engineer.  Everipedia is built using NextJS, React and Redux on the frontend and NestJS on the backend.

Though never publicly deployed, KizmetChain was an Ethereum crowdfunding platform I built in 2018.  This is the whitepaper.

I built Dragons of Destiny in 2014 using Swift.  It's iOS only and my top users were my girlfriend and one of my best friends.
